Project is complete, but I'd like to remind myself to return to it and mess around with things. For example,
I have started the kaggle competition for quora troll question classifier and I have all the quora questions.
I'd like to see how the email classifier would do if retrained for the questions. Also, I have a much larger corpus
that an be used. I'm still going to do the kaggle project in python, but it'd be interesting to adapt what I
already have in matlab too. That would be the quick and dirty iplimentation Prof. Ng talked about, which might give
insight into what I should spend time on in order to improve things.
